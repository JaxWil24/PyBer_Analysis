# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
* The PyBer Analysis was created to compare the prices, drivers, and total rides in three different types of cities.

## Results
* Urban cities as a whole have the most riders. Suburban next, then rural.

* The driver count for urban cities is almost twice as much as the rider count. The suburban driver count is less than the ride count, and the rural driver count is almost half that of the ride count.

* The total fares are different in the three types of cities. Urban is the highest, suburban second, rural last.

* Although the total fares started with urban cities making the most, rural cities are the most expensive per ride. Suburban trips follow around 4 dollars cheaper, then urban cities with about 24.50 as an average ride.

* With the different driver count, what each driver makes is a wide range across the city types. Rural drivers get the most, while urban drivers get the least. This is because of how many driver there are in urban cities campared to how little drivers there are in rural cities.

* All of this data was combined to make the summary dataframe I have added below.

## Summary
* A recommendation I would have for the CEOs would be to raise the rates for urban cities. Because of how many drivers there are, the average pay for the drivers is less than half of suburban drivers and less than a third of rural drivers. 

* Another recommendation would be to study the ride count in relation to the days a week. This would help to decide if there should be limits on the number of drivers in a certain area to regulate income for drivers. 

* The last recommendation I would have is to calculate the average fare price using time instead of individual rides. This would show a more accurate image of the income in comparison to the other cities. For example, urban drivers could be getting 18 a ride but complete three rides an hour, versus rural drivers could be making 50 a ride but only one ride in that hour.
